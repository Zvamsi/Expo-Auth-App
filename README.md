## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

-Sometimes third party browser's cannot complete signUp because of security reasons, from unauthorized domain like (netlify), thus need to be aware of that
The error is "Unable to process request due to missing initial state. This may happen if browser sessionStorage is inaccessible or accidentally cleared. Some specific scenarios are - 1) Using IDP-Initiated

SAML SSO. 2) Using signInWithRedirect in a storage-partitioned browser environment."
